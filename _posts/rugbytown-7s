# My journey from player to referee at Rugbytown 7s

## Opening Scene: A Journey Begins
-------------------------------

CLICK, and suddenly, the stadium bursts into life, lights casting a glow over the field. UP NEXT…, the announcer’s voice echos through the stadium, igniting a chorus of anticipation that reverberates throughout the arena. The stands transform into a vibrant tapestry — fans proudly waving banners, faces adorned with paint, and jerseys worn like badges of honor — all woven together in a symphony of cheers. Amidst this vibrant panorama, a band of players, a tightly-knit tribe, eager with excitement. The air crackles with pre-game excitement — hearts racing, gazes locked in, and an unspoken camaraderie that forms the heartbeat of the moment. “GO, GO, GO,” a voice in a red hat rallies us, propelling us forward like a tide of unwavering determination crashing onto the pitch. As I sprint from the northwest corner, the grass beneath my boots beats with life, each step echoing the rhythm of the game. One sole fan (maybe two) in the crowd yells — “Let’s go Hale!” — and those three words pierce through the crowd of cheers propelling me onward. Amidst this whirlwind, a feeling of reverence envelops me as I reach the midpoint of the field. A soft smile graces my lips as I take in the scene — Rugbytown 7s, a realm where dreams unfold.

_\*\*And then, in the blink of an eye, the scene transforms:\*\*_

The sharp blast of my whistle slices through the air, commanding attention with authority. Time seems to hold its breath for a fleeting moment, and then… it’s time to move. No longer a player amidst the tumultuous fray, I’ve assumed the mantle of the referee. The roles have seamlessly shifted, the focal point altered, and suddenly, the game unfolds in response to the rhythm of my calls. The intensity remains unwavering, the stakes undiluted, but it’s a different flavor of adrenaline — the thrill of orchestrating the game, of ensuring the symphony plays out without a single discordant note. The players surge ahead, the crowd roars once more, and I stand at the helm, steering this ship through the waters of competition.

From player to referee, a voyage through contrasts, a narrative of dual perspectives, all within the heart of Rugbytown 7s. And as the journey unfolds, remember, the northwest corner is where it all begins, with the voice of Dallen Stanford guiding us through this enthralling tale.

## Introduction
------------

Refereeing has become my passion, so much so that I find myself officiating matches on most weekends. With nearly two decades of rugby under my belt, I’ve spent the last eight years wearing the referee’s stripes. A couple of weeks ago, I had the privilege of competing for the USA in the Tag World Cup in Limerick, Ireland (its rugby league with flags) — a remarkable experience that prompted me to reflect on the essence of being a player. Throughout my journey, I’ve played high-level club rugby, from XVs and 7s National Championships to collegiate conference championships, and my personal favorite, Rugbytown 7s. My love for the game can be summed up for 3 reasons: (1) the thrill of competition (2) to be with the boys, some call it comradery (3) to earn a good win. These are 3 things that are hard to replicate as a referee, but refereeing has its own thrills as well. Before we dive into the details, there’s one intriguing fact that sets my journey apart — I am the first person (and so far only person) to have had the privilege to both play and referee at Rugbytown 7s. So let’s embark on this adventure together, exploring the nuances, challenges, and joys that define Rugbytown 7s’ two worlds.”

Competition: A Different Playing Field
--------------------------------------

In recent times, it’s evident that many tournaments and seasons carry a sense of predestination for referees. While we aim not to foster competitive rivalry and comparisons among referees, the reality is that such comparisons occur, albeit often without clear qualification. Distinct groups, like national, regional, and high-performance, serve as benchmarks. Even assignments become yardsticks for comparison. And honestly, I believe this is alright. Healthy competition drives improvement, both for referees and players. But I wish we were more transparent about it.

For players, competition sharpens our edge. The knowledge that someone could snatch your position compels you to strive for excellence, to stay ahead of the one chasing. However, it’s here that refereeing adds an extra layer. Referees are in constant pursuit of perfection — honing our skills, mastering the laws, and delivering optimal decisions. It’s not just about outperforming others; it’s about honing your craft to its utmost precision and consistently delivering performance week after week.

> _Focusing on those trailing behind doesn’t matter for referees, as they are in a race with themselves. While fixating on your pursuer could stall progress as a referee, the fear of falling behind does indeed ignite a unique fire — whether you’re a player or a referee._

I guess what I am trying to say is that the way we define competition for players and referees differs. In essence, players compete externally against their peers to secure their position, while referees compete internally to refine their craft and uphold the integrity of the game. The dynamics of competition may differ, but the dedication to improvement remains a common thread.

Rugbytown 7s follows the same pattern for both players and referees. Every match holds significant weight for players — a win means advancing, while a loss might cut your journey short, or worse, lead to no future invitations. Referees share a similar outlook; delivering strong performances grants access to competitive matches. However, a stark difference emerges. Despite putting forth your best effort, referee assignments can remain elusive. What’s within your control? The controllables, chiefly effort. Referee consistency plays a key role too. Just as a team can recover from a bad game and remain in the running, referees navigate a comparable path of ups and downs.

## Camaraderie: Unity and Solitude
-------------------------------

In the realm of refereeing, the concept of camaraderie can be a bit convoluted. We often tout the unity of the referee family, yet upon closer inspection, a better analogy might be “cousins” — still related, but the closeness can vary. on the field, we establish a trio with a discernible hierarchy of authority. But as players, these lines blur with shifting match dynamics. A captain and vice-captain exist, yet the limelight can shift when a player is having an exceptional day, you can feel a subtle shift in the team’s dynamics. If a wing scores four tries and wants to voice an opinion, today you listen, because maybe they are seeing something about the game others arent recognizing. However, in the realm of refereeing, the dynamic is distinct. Holding the role of head match official placed an encompassing burden on my shoulders. While Assistant Referees and the TMO provide support, this doesn’t drastically alter the power balance, even if the AR radio in with a commendable call.

Once off the field, the dynamics tend to dissipate for referees. Exiting the pitch ushers us into solitude. Social events trigger contemplation — will the losing team bear ill feelings? Could these interactions raise eyebrows during appointments? This aspect might seem puzzling.

> _Refereeing is solitary._

When it has been a challenging day or I’ve had a demanding game, teammates aren’t readily present for immediate solace. While reaching out to friends or colleagues virtually is an option, the tangible camaraderie experienced as players can’t be replicated. The unity among players, the cheers, and the mutual support help in momentarily banishing unpleasant memories — at least for that fleeting moment.

Thankfully, tournaments like Rugbytown 7s provide a bridge that narrows this gap, at least for a brief week. Following a refereed match, there’s a window of around 10 minutes to unwind on your own. Soon after, the trio of referees and your referee coach convene to discuss the game’s highlights and areas for improvement, not just for the main referee but also for the assistant referees. While this camaraderie might not mirror the player’s experience, it’s a semblance that comes quite close. For me, it’s a sufficient camaraderie, aligning with the unique role we play in the game of rugby.

## Winning with the Boys: Memories in Motion
-----------------------------------------

The thrill, the rush, the story that unfolds, the snapshots etched forever in our minds — these are the things that can’t be swapped out. Picture this: the Rugbytown 7s arena, the atmosphere electrifying in the Cup Quarter Final, Gorilla Rugby vs US Marine Corps. A far ruck ensues, the ball zipping through two pairs of hands until it lands perfectly in Corey Jones’ grip. With the finesse of a maestro, Corey tempts two Marine Corps defenders into following his lead. And then comes the moment that has me grinning to this day — he hits me with a pass that I catch one-handed, just as I hit the jets on an overs-line. So, there I was, a speeding bullet, hurtling 65 meters towards the tryline, a chorus of cheers urging me on. I couldn’t help but hear Corey’s voice in the faint-faint-faint distance in support, when someone is in support on a 7s pitch, you reward them… no worries, I had a plan. With all the confidence of a quarterback sending a Hail Mary, I launched the ball high into the sky, its trajectory hanging suspended for what felt like an eternity, surely Corey would catch up with this. It was the ultimate slow-motion moment. And then, with a perfection that would make any receiver proud, the ball nestled right into his awaiting hands. Corey swan-dived between the sticks, the clock struck 0:00, victory was ours, and we celebrated in style, with a Kenya 7s dance move we’d perfected the night before. And there you have it, my friends — a memory etched in the annals of time, an experience that referees simply don’t get to savor.

Rugbytown 7s — 2021

> _Hold on, though! I’ve got to tell you, I’ve also amassed quite a collection of vibrant memories that can rival those of my playing days._

I vividly remember my first Rugbytown experience as a referee. For a solid four years, I’d been aiming to be a part of the event as a referee, but the stars hadn’t aligned. Then came my chance, and I was determined to make it count. I put in the hours as an Assistant Referee, worked hard as a match official, and guess what? In my very first year, I got the nod to be the Head Match Official for the Military Championship. Picture this: standing on the field, surrounded by my chosen team of five, military squads on both sides, with the national anthem ringing in the air — trust me, it’s a darn good feeling.

_In case you’re not in the know, Rugbytown got its start in 2012, bringing together rugby programs within the US Armed Forces, all hosted at Infinity Park in Glendale, CO. And you know what they say — the USA has a big heart for its military._

So, being assigned to referee the Military Championship final at Rugbytown isn’t just a feather in the cap; it’s a colossal accomplishment that blends three potent elements: (1) Sports, (2) Military, and (3) Patriotism. What’s more, this final showdown is the one and only match of the day. It’s a game that referees relish because the fans are on the edge of their seats cheering for both teams. And let me tell you, the stands erupt with joy whenever something exciting unfolds on the field.

## Rugbytown: A Bridge Between Worlds

Rugbytown is truly exceptional, whether you’re a player or a referee. Regardless of your role, Rugbytown has a knack for making you feel like a true professional. Flights organized, your own comfortable bed, per diem, and game pay — all set against a week dedicated solely to rugby. These are the perks that I experienced both as a player and as a referee. Think daily training sessions, comprehensive film reviews, and in-depth discussions about decisions — it’s an absolute blast of an experience.

# The Daily Grind: From Sunrise to Sundown
## As a player

We arrive about a 4–5 days before the start of the tournament. Our daily routine kicks off around 7am, with breakfast filling our bellies. By 8am, we hit the pitch for our first run of the day, followed by a well-deserved snack and nap, if you’re wise, after 90 minutes. The afternoon brings another training session around 1pm, followed by a lunch break. Our third training session could take place on the field or in the classroom, focusing on team tactics. Dinner follows, along with some team social activities, before we call it a day and head to bed. On GameDay, the rhythm remains similar, with training swapped for matches. It’s a cycle of waking up, training, moving to the match pitch, training again, playing, eating, training once more, and finally, playing again.

## As a referee

Typically, we arrive just a day or two before the tournament begins, leaving us with minimal time to adjust to Glendale, CO’s elevation of 5,280 feet. This underscores the importance of being in peak physical condition, just like players, especially for a 7s referee. After settling into the hotel, I enjoy strolling around the city, taking in the surroundings as I make my way to the pitch, visualizing the upcoming matches. Rugbytown boasts one of the best pitches in the United States. Stepping onto the field, the vastness of the pitch, venue, and event is palpable. Here, my excitement as a referee ignites. My heart is racing, and the game’s anticipation floods my thoughts. Passes, switches, jumps, tackles — they play out vividly in my mind. Mentally prepared, I’m ready to go. Soon, it’s back to the hotel, likely for a referee meeting.

During the meeting, we delve into event expectations and crew responsibilities. We navigate through a few scenarios and break the ice by getting acquainted with fellow referees.

## Player vs Referee

As a player, by the time the initial whistle echoes through Rugbytown, I’ve spent a week getting mentally and physically ready in an intense environment. I’ve engaged in live tackles, scrums against teammates, and scrimmaged against other clubs. If anything seems awry, there has been a team around me, offering insights and solutions. We, the team, are synchronized, and systems aligned, and now it’s time to shine on the field.

Transitioning to the role of a referee shifts the preparation solely onto my shoulders, physically and mentally. Leading up to the event, a few Zoom calls are the extent of our interaction. Physically, it’s my responsibility. Mental readiness is entirely within my grasp. Scrimmages are scarce; if I stumble upon a team and they need a referee, there might be time, given my typical arrival just a day before kick-off though, it's not likely. When the tournament launches, referees must be better equipped than the players — it’s not a hope, but a requirement. This demand is one of the fuels of excitement for me as a referee.

# Gametime: The Art of Officiating

## During Match

As the whistle sounds off, our role as referees revolves around deciphering the teams’ strategies and facilitating their execution within the boundaries of the laws of the game. In the fast-paced world of 7s, referees have a tiny window to make sense of it all. We must supply what the game demands from the first contested action, often within the first 7 seconds of the match.

As a player, my focus isn’t on the referee’s intentions. Instead, my aim is to execute the team’s plan and reap the rewards for my efforts on the field. It can be exasperating when referees inject their own agenda into the game. Imagine winning a turnover and wanting to launch a quick attack, only to find the referee out of position or calling back a tap because it’s half a meter off the mark — nullifying the team’s advantage. Or witnessing an obvious knock-on that halts everyone except the culprit, causing a missed call.

## Aftermath of a Bad Performance

When the match is over, players don’t have the luxury of a do-over; a loss dictates the path ahead. As a player, a poor performance leads to contemplation, a feeling of letting the team down. Yet, the presence of the captain, coach, or teammate offers solace, guiding you to move forward and focus on the next game. With a strong showing in the next match, the memory of the previous one fades away, replaced by the triumph of the present.

Similarly, as a referee, a subpar performance feels like a stain. The weight of disappointing the referee community and losing the respect of the teams lingers — a reputation that isn’t easily regained, as teams have long memories. The absence of immediate comfort amplifies the impact. While we might rationalize every decision, the specter of a poor showing persists until it’s replaced by a series of consistently stellar performances. When a referee falters, the outcome remains uncertain. Will another game come my way? Probably. But will it be a game of significance? That remains a question mark.

# Too Much Fun: Rollercoaster of Roles

The positives and negatives of playing versus refereeing make both sides of the coin intriguing. Refereeing a cracker of the match and walking away knowing you allowed the players to decide the outcome on the field rivals that of being a player, but nothing beats the victory with the boys. Nothing beats the social and reflecting on the game. Nothing beats the ups and downs you feel as a player. The thrill of having the rugby ball in hand, the excitement of poaching a critical ball, the joy seen on the faces of teammates after you dot down a try. As a referee, we don’t get to celebrate those critical moments on the pitch. The focus must stay from start to finish, but when that final whistle blows and you walk over to shake a team’s hand, they tell you “Great game ref” It all makes it worthwhile and that’s the win in my book.

Playing versus refereeing, it’s a whole rollercoaster of ups and downs, intriguing on both sides. Refereeing a super intense match where you let the players battle it out on the field, that’s up there with being a player. But honestly, nothing beats the post-game hangout with the squad, hashing out the match. The player’s emotions — the thrill of having the rugby ball, snagging a clutch ball, the joy of scoring a try — that’s a unique high.

Nevertheless holding the whistle and being the conductor on this fast-moving train is about as close as you can get with being a player, without having to tackle. The mental and physical fortitude. The adrenaline rush. The trill of having the best seat in the house. Focus has to be on point from the first whistle to the last. Yet, when the final whistle blows and you stroll over for the team handshake, and they’re like, “Great game, ref!” — that’s the win that sticks.
