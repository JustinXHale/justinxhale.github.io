## Peer Recognition (Red Hat Rewards)

We appreciate the way you approach your work and your ability to collaborate with others. We look forward to when our paths will cross again! - Matt Carleton, Manager, Software Engineering /Peter Kreuser,Principal Interaction Designer*

### Red Hat Multiplier (Collaborate)
> *"Thanks so much for sharing the command line design work you did, and for taking the time to walk through it with me 1:1. It was a real inspiration and eye opener for me to see that someone had dove in wholeheartedly to the extent that you did. Thanks again! You inspired me to get my hands dirty with the RHEL Lightspeed command line assistant work, and I appreciate it!" - John Carr, Senior Interaction Designer*

> *"Hey Justin! It was a pleasure getting to work with you on Konveyor this year. I really appreciate your approachability, adaptability and communication. Your design sync meetings are more productive than most meetings I've attended, and you've done a great job handling the tricky push-and-pull with PM and devs as the team iterated on your designs. I look forward to working with you more in the future." -Mike Turley,Senior UXD Front-end Developer*

> *"Leading the Quay User Experience. Thank you for your UX works, and especially for analysis of what's missing in Quay 3.9 UI and creating the spreadsheet that formed the basis of our 3.10 plans." -Oleg Bulatov, Principle Software Engineer*

> *"For helping to identify what steps Quay needs to take to achieve parity between its old and new UI. Justin, Thanks so much for breaking down the outstanding work to achieve parity in Quay. The detailed deck and sheet are worth their weight in gold." -Dave O'Connor,Manager, Engineering*

> *"Thank you for your contribution for the new Quay UI. You've done a phenomenal job with the new Quay UI mocks. Thank you for having a short turn around time on the mocks and for even shorter response time on Slack. Thank you for all your work!" -Sunanda Dadi,Senior Software Engineer*

### Team Advocate (Amplify Strengths)
> *"Justin started on the RHEL AI team several months ago. He immediately rolled up his sleeves and started to dig in and learn the very complex technology. He is very self motivated and did this with little guidance. As he has learned new things, he has shared them with other UXD team members. He documents everything he does so that others can learn from him. Justin has also made name for himself on the engineering side by attending open source meetings, sharing design ideas and collaborating through open channels. Justin's collaborative nature has had a very positive impact on our whole team as we navigate this new product and product team." -Beau Morley,Principal UX Designer*

> *"AWESOMENESS. Thank you VERY MUCH for helping me in my journey into InstructLab. Take this award as a token of my appreciation." -,Senior Principal Chief Architect*

### Team Advocate (Focus of Team)
> *"A big thank you to the designers and researchers who contribute their time an energy to enhancing PatternFly and thereby strengthening the user experience across Red Hat products. It is through your efforts that PatternFly remains the cornerstone of our product design toolkit. Thank you for your contributions to PatternFly design throughout the year! Your efforts are always appreciated and it's a pleasure to work with you on this project." -Matt Carrano, Manager, Software Engineering*

> *"I want to recognize Justin for going above and beyond to help me troubleshoot and set up InstructLab using my CLI—something I have very little experience doing. Justin's willingness to meet with me, patiently work through issues, and take the time to explain the what and why behind the process was incredibly helpful. Justin also created an impressive Miro board to document the setup process which shows his dedication to supporting colleagues and improving workflows. His effort has not only helped me, but will make the setup process smoother for everyone in the future. Justin, thank you for all your help and your outstanding contribution to the InstructLab CLI onboarding experience. Super impressive work you are doing!" -Maria Denisco,User Experience Designer*
