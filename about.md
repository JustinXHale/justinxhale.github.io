# About Me

Hi, I’m Justin X. Hale, a UX designer passionate about crafting thoughtful, user-centered experiences. My journey into UX has been anything but traditional. It started with a love for problem-solving and a curiosity for how design can make life easier—whether that’s creating seamless workflows for developers or simplifying complex systems.

I currently work at Red Hat, where I focus on improving developer tools, particularly in the Command Line Interface (CLI) space. I love digging into how people interact with technology and finding ways to make those interactions smoother and more intuitive. For me, it’s about understanding the user’s perspective and turning that into designs that truly empower them.

When I’m not immersed in the world of UX, you can often find me on the rugby pitch as a referee. Rugby is one of my greatest passions, and being a referee gives me a unique perspective on leadership, quick decision-making, and respect for teamwork—all of which tie back to how I approach design.

Outside of work and rugby, I’m a husband and a dad to a wonderful daughter. Family is at the heart of everything I do, and they inspire me to keep pushing boundaries in both my personal and professional life.

If I had to sum myself up: I’m a curious problem-solver, a team player, and someone who thrives on collaboration and growth. Whether it's working on a new UX challenge or officiating a high-stakes rugby match, I’m all about bringing my best to the table.
