# Itâ€™s Just an Email  
**Case study read time:** 6â€“10 minutes  

## Overview  
- **Project Scope:** 4 weeks  
- **Project Type:** Assignment  
- **Role:** UX Design, UI Design, Copywriter, Light HTML Coder  
- **Tools:** Paper, Pencil, Figma, Miro, Photoshop, Brackets, WebAIM Contrast Checker  
- **UX Techniques:** Stakeholder interviews, Secondary Research, Customer Flow, Sketching, Wireframing  
- **Participants:** Integral Staff, Application Development  

## Background  
Integral Care supports the health and well-being of adults and children living with mental illness, substance use disorder, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. This non-profit supported over half a million people in 2020, and as it expanded its telehealth services, they wanted to improve customer retention and satisfaction with their emails.

## Problem(s)  
Clients receive a lot of information in their initial and only email. Feedback from Integral staff revealed the following issues:  
- Email is long and complicated  
- Content is confusing to understand  
- Difficulty retrieving email before/during appointments  

## Solution  
Developed a responsive HTML email template that integrates with the clientâ€™s mail client, allowing users to save appointments and reminders directly to their native calendar.

## My Role  
### Emphasize
I managed most aspects of the project, from initial stakeholder interviews to ideation, prototyping, user testing, and coding, before handing it off to the application developer for final implementation.

## Interviews  
During the discovery phase, I conducted interviews with the Director of Clinical Services and the Program Manager Supervisor of the Call Center to better understand the problem.  

### Guiding Questions  
- What is the process your user goes through before receiving an email?  
- What is the purpose of the email?  
- What do you want to accomplish with the email?  
- Who receives the email?  
- Is there a follow-up email?  
- What have customers told you about the email?  
- Demographics of clients  

## Define  
### Client Journey  
To visualize how clients find and interact with the service, I created a Customer Journey Map to understand their pain points and provide a birdâ€™s-eye view for stakeholders.

## Ideate  
### Initial Sketches  
I started with hand-drawn sketches to brainstorm ideas before transitioning to digital tools. I also conducted desktop research to analyze email templates used by other organizations.

## Prototype  
### Color Visualization  
To better understand the number of touchpoints in the email, I created a color-coded visualization of the content. This helped stakeholders see the distribution of information at a glance.

**Color Decoder**:  
- **Grey:** Text  
- **Dark Blue:** Notice  
- **Light Blue:** H1 or Link  
- **Red:** H1  
- **Purple:** Link

### Wireframes  
Based on sketches, I created high-fidelity wireframes for desktop and mobile views.  

**Required Components**:  
- Microsoft Teams meeting information  
- Help video  
- Crisis helpline phone number  

**Recommended Additions**:  
- Shorten email content from 2,220+ characters to under 600  
- Add-to-calendar feature  
- Call-to-reschedule button  
- Helpline button with direct dial prompts

#### Solicit Opinion
After I completed the mockup I connected with the Senior Creative Designer asked a trusted co-worker about their option of the layout. Together we decided on some element and layout changes that saved space and highlighted some key areas. (Youâ€™ll see in the next section ðŸ™‚ )

## Test & Iterate  
### Coding the Email  
Given the tight 4-week deadline, I coded the email in HTML using VSCode to expedite the process. This saved time for the MIS team and allowed faster implementation.

**Feedback**:  
*"This is great. This saves a lot of time!" â€“ Andrew, Applications Developer*

Using my code, the application developer completed a project that would have taken one week in just 30 minutes. Dynamic Microsoft Teams links and calendar integration streamlined the user experience.

### Weâ€™re almost done.
Using my code, the application developer was able to take a project that would have taken at least one week and pushed it out in 30 minutes!
Using dynamic Microsoft Teams links and the clientâ€™s native email client for their appointment, allowed us to remove another button, giving the client choices to click on.

## Project Learnings  
### Key Takeaways  
- **Less Is More**: Simplicity improves user engagement.  
- **Accessibility Matters**: Font sizes, color contrast, and alt text were prioritized.  
- **Collaboration is Key**: Working closely with stakeholders enhanced the final product.  

## Deliverables  
### Before  
The original email was lengthy, unclear, and not user-friendly.
