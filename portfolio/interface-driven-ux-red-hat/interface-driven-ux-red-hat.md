## Interface-Driven UX at Red Hat

This portfolio entry highlights a set of UI-focused projects I led or significantly contributed to during my time at Red Hat. Each one reflects my approach to designing for technical users—prioritizing clarity, system alignment, and scalable documentation. These projects span enterprise migrations, onboarding workflows, low-fidelity explorations, and iterative collaboration with PMs and devs.

### Quay.io Redesign & Migration

**Challenge:**  
Migrate the legacy Angular-based Quay UI to PatternFly while embedding it into both OpenShift Console and console.redhat.com.

**My Role:**  
I led UX for the migration across multiple core flows—repository management, org settings, robot accounts, and more. I aligned the interface with OpenShift conventions, introduced new features like bulk repo actions, and created async visual documentation to support developer implementation.

**Team:**  
3 Designers (eventually just me), 2 PMs, Eng. Manager, 4–7 Developers

**Deck:**

### Konveyor Quick Start Onboarding

**Challenge:**  
Improve onboarding in the Konveyor app modernization toolkit. Users often felt lost after landing in the UI.

**My Role:**  
Proposed and designed a quick start experience using PatternFly’s framework. Worked closely with content design, frontend engineering, and the PF team to scope, shape, and deliver the first version.

**Team:**  
1 PM, 1 Dev, UX Content Designer, PatternFly Contributor

### PM-Led Vision → UX Realization (Assessments UX)

**Challenge:**  
Bring a PM’s conceptual sketch for an assessment flow to life, evolving it into a functional UI.

**My Role:**  
Took early sketches and iterated across multiple versions—balancing feasibility, visual clarity, and user flow. By version 2, the PM described it as “exactly what I was envisioning.” Final design was shared with the broader team for approval.

**Team:**  
1 PM, 1 Dev, UX Content, Peer Reviews

### SLA (Lo-Fi) Exploration

**Challenge:**  
Present nuanced support tier options (Red Hat Premium, Partner Support, Self-Support) in a clean, scalable way.

**My Role:**  
Designed an early low-fidelity layout for SLA selection using Figma. Focused on chunking dense support descriptions and aligning dropdowns, tier logic, and required fields.

**Why It Matters:**  
Not every problem needs high-fidelity to move forward. This lo-fi prototype helped align stakeholders early in the process.
